Hi there! My name is Christian, and I am a senior PHP developer with 8+ years of experience in the field. I work on a high-loaded international classified portal and have a knack for technologies like PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, and IntelliJ Platform. When I'm not coding, I like to give new productivity techniques a crack, travel to new spots, and enjoy hobbies like cooking, photography, and strumming the ol' ukulele.

I'm always keen to give new things a go and have a bit of fun, so if you want to chat about software development or just want to hear some woeful ukulele covers, don't be shy - give me a shout!

## Education:
Interregional Academy of Personnel Management
Bachelor's degree, Information Technology

_2009 - 2013_

While I was studying for my Bachelor's degree, I'll admit that I was a bit of a slacker at first. I just couldn't seem to get motivated to hit the books. But then I discovered web development, and it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. I was all like, "Yo, this stuff is lit!" and suddenly I was putting in the hours and getting my grind on. It was a complete 180 from where I was before. I am so hyped that the time I spent at the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management opened up the world of web development to me.

## A Little More About Me:

Aside from my work technical skills and experiences, I'm also a bit of a productivity nerd. I love using apps, like Notions, Things, and Obsidian to stay organized and on top of my work, and I'm always looking for new techniques like the 52/17 rule, GTD method, and PARA method. I'm always open to trying new ways of getting things done (although I'll admit, I'm still trying to figure out how to make the Pomodoro technique work for me).

Outside of work, I've got a soft spot for Asian culture and love nothing more than traveling to new and exciting places, especially if there are some delicious cuisine and good waves for surfing. I also enjoy hobbies like cooking, photography, and playing the ukulele in my free time (tbh my ukulele skills are still a work in progress). And while I may not be the most talented surfer or ukulele player out there, I love trying new things and having fun. So if you want to chat about anything from software development to the best spots for surfing (or just want to hear some terrible ukulele covers), don't hesitate to reach out!
